            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>
                Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American media magnate, internet
                entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He is known for co-founding the social media website Facebook and its
                parent company Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is the chairman, chief executive
                officer, and controlling shareholder.[1][2]


                Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates
                Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Originally launched to select
                college
                campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012.
                Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the
                world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of March 2022, Zuckerberg's net worth was $74.5 billion
                according
                to the Forbes' Real Time Billionaires.

                Since 2008, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 most influential people in the world as a
                part
                of its Person of the Year award, which he was recognized with in 2010.[3][4][5] In December 2016,
                Zuckerberg
                was ranked tenth on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.[6]

                <a href=" https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/mark-zuckerberg-books">
                    https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/mark-zuckerberg-books</a>

                <p class="c1">Zuckerberg actually started an online book club in 2015, and has always been an advocate
                    for reading.
                    “I’ve found reading books very intellectually fulfilling,” said Zuckerberg. “Books allow you to
                    fully
                    explore a topic and immerse yourself in a deeper way than most media today. I’m looking forward to
                    shifting more of my media diet towards reading books.”</p>

                <p class="c1">The list has garnered Zuckerberg a bit of attention—more specifically, one particular book
                    raised a few
                    eyebrows earlier this year. Zuckerberg recommended “The Last Days of Night” by Graham Moore. Moore’s
                    book told the story of Thomas Edison’s electricity monopoly, and the lengths that he went to in
                    order to
                    protect that monopoly. With 2020 Democratic presidential candidate calling for big tech companies
                    like
                    Facebook and Amazon being broke up to create more domestic tech competition, a book about protecting
                    your monopoly is what some might call a bold choice. Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote in a blog post,
                    “Today’s big tech companies have too much power—too much power over our economy, our society, and
                    our
                    democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the
                    playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled
                    innovation.” In the midst of such comments, reading a book that is essentially a how-to for
                    monopolist
                    is interesting to say the least.

                </p>
                <p class="c1">But that wasn’t all that Zuckerberg read during 2019. His reading selection covered
                    non-fiction books
                    that discussed the benefits of the free market as well as sci-fi novels that explored where
                    technology
                    could be taking us. Zuckerberg read “The Muqaddimah,” a book about Islamic history. His interest in
                    justice informed his reading choices, as did his curiosity about foreign relationships and the
                    modern
                    global economy. The titles Zuckerberg read cover a wide gamut of topics and genres—there’s something
                    for
                    everyone on the list. It will be interesting to see what books capture the Facebook CEO’s attention
                    in
                    2020.
